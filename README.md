# CO2 Emissions Dashboard
This is an animated `dashboard` representing global `CO2 Emissions and Emissions per Capita` trends by year, built with `D3.JS`, `TopoJSON` and `SVGs`

The statistical data used has been sourced and compiled from [UN data](https://data.un.org/), while the map data has been sourced from [World Atlas](unpkg.com/world-atlas@1.1.4/world/50m.json)

This project can also be found here on [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/co2-emissions-dashboard-ptlc2)

Below is a preview of how it looks:
